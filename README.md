# Forecasting with Zillow Rent Price Dataset

We are doing big things here. I tried to offer a teaser with the uploaded pdf. I'm making a comeback to project making. Make no mistake, however, I am making a comeback for the _community_. Because that's what David preaches. Incessantly. Shout out to Ling Lang Vince and OG Mud Bone Ravi. Without them, the place would be dark and, thus, unlit.

## Technologically Advanced Tools for Tools Like Myself

In this project, I will be using `R`, `SQL`, and `Python`. Once I imported the CSV into `R`, I realized I had forgotten how to clean data in `R`. So I switched over to `Python` and used `pandas`. For the dazzling visuals that are not that lit, I made use of the OG homie's Hadley Wickham's package `ggplot`. Hadley and I are connected on LinkedIn, so we are boys now.

I will be making use of the XTS, ZOO, and Forecast package in `R` from some guy named Rob J. Hyndman. He didn't connect with me on LinkedIn, which has hitherto been a salt throwing war. 


## Proper Updates Await

I probably should have written a more sophisticated README, now that I think about it. I am kind of committed at this point.
